# Week by Week Learning Plan

As a big team of learners we believe it is very important that insights are shared into our learning processes so that we can all improve together. We are also very keen for you all to become "Github" natives as part of your professional development.

If there is any feedback you would like to give on your Makers experience that you would prefer to go direct to a member of the team, then please message us directly on Slack. Wherever possible we'd prefer to get feedback in open forums where it can be discussed with the appropriate groups.

The Makers learning plan is used to "diarise" your learning and summarise 4 key points about your week. This, coupled with our learning objectives will help you easily monitor your own progress, gain assistance from your peers and our team where needed and also provide feedback to your colleagues where you can too!

**To clarify that indeed the learning plan/self-review you are filling in on your GitHub repos are in principle readable by all students and staff; but not visible to anyone outside Makers Academy.**

If you all need help to complete this, lean on your mentors or grab a member of the Makers team at anytime!

So to do this you need to :

1. Go to the link above
2. Fork the plan into your own Github
3. Clone the plan down to your laptop
4. Make the edits
5. Push your changes back up to Github
6. Send us a pull request with your changes
