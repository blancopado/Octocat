PreCourse Week 1
================

Most Important Things I Learned:
-------------------------------

* I learned a lot about git and linking my local repositories with Github.
* I have a better understanding of several useful commands for the Linux command line.

Things I Struggled With The Most:
-------------------------------

* I  struggled the most with git. I am still confused about syncing my fork with the original one and creating an "upstream" remote.
* I struggled with the command substitution concept in bash, but I finally understood how to use it.


Changes I Plan to Make Next Week:
-------------------------------

* I will save time to have a look at the optional material. 
* 


Other Experiences or General Feedback This Week:
-------------------------------

* I'd like to have the answers for the 2nd part of the Octocat challenge. I submitted all the questions but I am still confused about syncing my fork with the original one and creating an "upstream" remote.
